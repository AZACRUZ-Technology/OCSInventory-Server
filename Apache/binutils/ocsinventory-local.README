OCS Inventory-NG

ocsinventory-local.pl is a script designed to send inventory to an OCS server using .ocs files generated by -local (or /local for windows).
Since 1.02 release, you can use the OCS_OPT_GENERATE_OCS_FILES server parameter to automatically generate these files to "inject" it to a higher level server. (in case of multi entity configuration for example).
In that case, you can use a cron if the two servers are connected, or put it on the higher level server and run it on loopback.
